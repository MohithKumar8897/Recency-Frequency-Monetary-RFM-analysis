## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset `dating_app_dataset.csv` contains user behavior and demographic data from a dating app. Key features include:

- **User ID**: A unique identifier for each user.
- **Age**: The age of the user.
- **Gender**: The gender of the user (e.g., Male, Female).

- **Interests**: A list of interests or hobbies.
- **Looking For**: Dating preferences (e.g., Long-term Relationship, Marriage).
- **Children**: Whether the user has children (“Yes,” “No,” “Maybe”).
- **Education Level**: Highest education attained.
- **Occupation**: The user’s current occupation.
- **Swiping History**: A numerical score based on user interactions (likes/dislikes).
- **Frequency of Usage**: App engagement frequency (e.g., Daily, Monthly).
- **App Usage Frequency**: Total number of app interactions in a given timeframe.
- **Last Active Date**: Most recent login or activity date.
- **Total Spend**: Amount spent on premium features or services.

This dataset is used to understand engagement, cluster users, and make targeted recommendations.
